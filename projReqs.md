Q3 - Group New Technology Project
The goal of this project is to put what you've learned to use to:

Write a project proposal and get it approved by an instructor
Follow an agile development workflow
Create and deploy a full-stack web app
Make a video highlighting the functionality of your app
Complete a write-up of the project
Add all three of these to an online portfolio
Present your work to the class

Write a project proposal and present it to the class
For this project, you will do a one minute presentation of your idea to the class. Your presentation must include a mock up of your idea. After project proposals, you will be assigned to groups of 3 based on interest in the ideas presented. After that, your group will need to flesh out the idea and get it approved by an instructor.

A project description
Who uses it?
What outputs do they need?
What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
A list of technologies that you plan to use
A well-defined and written-out feature list
There are some constraints around what technologies MUST be present in your app. Check out Create and deploy a web app below.

Follow Agile Workflow
The methodologies, tools, and roles you use are up to your team.

Create and deploy a complete fullstack app
Your app should:

Have a working front-end and back-end
Use a single-page app framework for the front-end. It must function well on a mobile device.
Persist data
Include Oauth and require users to log in to your app.
Use a third-party API
Use some significant technology that was not covered in the program. Examples include:
Using Ember, Vue, Angular, React/Redux etc. on the front-end
Making a native mobile app using a wrapper like ionic framework/React Native/PhoneGap/Cordova etc.
Making a desktop app with Electron  /React Native etc.
Internet of Things - Integrating a physical device/sensor/internet of things
Using Rails, Spring, Java, Python or some other backend framework for building APIs
Razzle dazzle. There should be at least one part of your app that makes people go "oooohhhh!!!". This project should be one of the strongest pieces in your portfolio, so keep that goal in mind.
All of the quality standards from earlier projects are the same as far as clean code, commit messages, READMEs, etc.

Make a video highlighting the functionality of your app
Make a 3-6 minute video explaining your project and demonstrating its features

Complete a write-up of the project
Describe what the project is, the technologies you used, and some information about the workflow you followed. Include an Agile group retro that includes, what went will, what did not go well and what you would do differently next time.
1-2 pages

Add all three of these to an online portfolio
Create a portfolio on the student portal 
Link to your final deployed site, your video, your repositories, and your write-up
This will be added to your web development portfolio

Present your work to the class
Be prepared to spend 5-7 minutes presenting your work to the class. Each member of your group needs to be involved in the presentation. Practice your presentation before delivering it. ---
This is a realistic approximation of what developing real products on a software team is like. You will have approximately 20-25 hours of class time to work on this. It will not be enough time to do a good job on this project. Plan on spending extra time outside of class, and coordinate this time with your team. This is another Big Deal Week, and you should put maximum effort into making it successful. You can and should use your teammates, classmates on other teams, and your instructors as learning resources, but this should be your own work.
